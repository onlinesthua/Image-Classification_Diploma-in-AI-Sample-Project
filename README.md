Project 1: Image Classification with Transfer Learning

This project focuses on Image Classification as a Computer Vision deep learning problem and explores the use of transfer learning to ease model construction. Image Classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, with applications ranging from medical imaging to usage in autonomous vehicles.

By utilizing transfer learning, a pre-trained Resnet model is fine-tuned on a new dataset. The project aims to demonstrate how existing knowledge from one domain can be leveraged to solve similar problems efficiently. This not only speeds up the training process but also requires less labeled data, making it especially useful when working with limited datasets.

Potential Applications:
1.	Medical Imaging: Classifying medical images to assist in diagnoses, such as identifying different types of tumors or diseases.
2.	Object Detection: Identifying objects in images for applications like surveillance or inventory management.
3.	Autonomous Vehicles: Classifying objects in real-time to aid in navigation and decision-making for self-driving cars.

Learning outcomes:
1.	Understanding of transfer learning techniques and their application in deep learning.
2.	Proficiency in implementing image classification models using TensorFlow Keras API.
3.	Ability to fine-tune pre-trained models to adapt them to new tasks or datasets.

* The Dataset is not included in the repository in considerations of storage space.
This project is prepared by Chen Yijie under the supervision of Zhou Changxin
